# transcribr_app

This is my submission for the technical challenge. This is a flutter app with robust rolling buffer 30s recording functionality including when backgrounded. 

All other functionality is outstanding (transcription, fastapi) I felt it was better to submit something solid on time. 

You can see in the code that some attempts were made to connect transcription services, but I felt it was better to submit one thing working well, than a big thing that doesn't work. Thank you
